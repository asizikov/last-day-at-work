# last-day-at-work


A small tool I wrote to gather some statistics from GitHub.

You know, last day at work, before deleting all the access keys and leaving an organization.

The tool doesn't do much: just gets a list of repositories for the organization, gets the number of your commits to each repo and sums it up.
